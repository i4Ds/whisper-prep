# Generation configuration
maintain_speaker_chance: 0.5 # Probability of keeping the same speaker for consecutive utterances
n_samples_per_srt: 120 # Number of audio samples to combine into each SRT file
normalize_text: True # If text should be cleaned based on the rules in src/whisper_prep/generation/text_normalizer.py

# Overlap settings
overlap_chance: 0.8 # Probability of creating an overlap between consecutive audio clips
                    # Overlap occurs only in non-speech segments, as detected by Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

max_overlap_chance: 0.5 # Probability of maximum overlap when an overlap occurs
                        # If triggered, non-speech audio is removed, resulting in back-to-back speech
                        # If not triggered, a random amount of non-speech audio is kept between utterances
                        # It can only trigger if overlap_chance was triggered
max_overlap_duration: 0.3  # Max duration of the overlap in seconds. So if there is an overlap triggered, then the overlap will be between 0 and max_overlap_duration, thus having two speech overlap.
